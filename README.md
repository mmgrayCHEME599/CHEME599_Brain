Repository for CHEME599 Term Project on segmenting and tracking neurons in two-photon calcium imaging datasets

This is a work in progress! The code won't help you with anything for now. Check back for future updates.

**Project Goals**
1. Filter images to remove extraneous information
2. Segment Neurons
3. Track Neurons in multi-day datasets
